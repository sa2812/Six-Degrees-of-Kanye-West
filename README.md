The `spotify.py` uses the [`Spotipy`](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) package to access the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).

From here, information on artists is collected and saved to a database, the structure of which is still being decided.

From the database, a network will be created and this will allow all sorts of analytics to take place relating to the network of artists.
